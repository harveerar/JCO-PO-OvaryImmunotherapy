## Statistical Methods

volumeTTV and several radiomic measures (namely, cluster-site-dissimilarity, Contrastlargest-lesion, Homogeneity largest-lesion) demonstrated highly skewed distributions and were logarithmically transformed for further analysis.   

The Cox proportional hazard regressions were used to examine Uunivariate and multivariable associations of clinical variables and baseline CE-CT derived image-based measures baseline CE-CT-derived total tumor volume, number of disease sites, intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity radiomic measures with time to off-treatment. were tested with the Cox proportional hazard regression analyses. Patients were censored who wereif remaining on-treatment at the time of last follow-up were censored. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals were estimated. Ann estimated hazard ration (HR)HR >1 indicated higher risk of off-treatment and an HR <1 indicated lower risk. Univariate and multivariable The aassociations of these featurevariables with durable clinical benefit were tested with the Wilcoxon rank-sum testexamined using logistic regressionsfor univariate analysis and the logistic regression for multivariable analysis. Variables with a univariate test p value<0.10 entered the multivariable analysis, and  Tthe final multivariable model was selected based on backward selection via the the likelihood ratio testAkaike information criteria.   

A sensitivity analysis on model selection was performed using cross-validated LASSO regression including all variables with 200 random repetitions. The variables included in final the multivariable models were also selected >905% times by LASSO regression. Model discriminability was assessed using thehe receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis and internally validated concordance statistics (c-index) were estimated to assess model fitting 31 with regard to the durable clinical benefit. In multivariable logistic regression, bias-correct c-index was estimated using bootstrapping technique. The correlations were assessed with Spearmanâ€™s correlation coefficient. All statistical analyses were performed in the software packages R, version 3.5 (The R Foundation for statistical computing).

The above model had a bias-correct c-index of `r c.mvs2`, improved from the univariate analyses of having either number of sites or the largest energy. Other variables did not significantly improve the model fitting.

Only one variable remained using backward selection, no multivariable model for time to off-treatment was reported.

           "lcSE.Baseline")],
      method = "spearman")
```

Correlation was strong between number of sites and cluster-site-dissimilarity/cluster-site-entropy (Spearman correlation coefficient `r  round(corr1[3,1],3)`/`r round(corr1[4,1],3)`), but low between energy and number of sites/cluster-site-dissimilarity/cluster-site-entropy (`r round(corr1[2,1],3)`/`r round(corr1[2,3],3)`/`r round(corr1[2,4],3)`, respectively). Cluster-site-dissimilarity and cluster-site-entropy had very strong correlation (Spearman correlation coefficient `r round(corr1[3,4],3)`).
